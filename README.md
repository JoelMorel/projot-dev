# projot-dev
a webapp for storing ideas for future projects. 

This is an application to jot down ideas for future projects. It was created by myself as part of a learning experience.
I wanted to create a full stack web application, and in doing so utilize as many tools as possible in the process of deploying ProJot to
the world.
